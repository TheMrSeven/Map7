# Map7
Just a creation to make CTF life a little bit easier.
We all start with the exact same stuff, the same commands and the same folders. So I created this script to automate the boring stuff, and help stay organized.
This will run nmap scripts on the optimized way without crompromissing the scan and create folders for the common services that it found.
